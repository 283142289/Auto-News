In an interview with Fox News on Tuesday, Trump responded to the rebuke from Roberts by saying that “he didn’t mention my name in the statement”. He then renewed his attack on the federal judge, saying “many people have called for his impeachment” and he was “radical left”. “He actually said we shouldn’t be able to take criminals, killers, murderers, horrible, the worst people, gang members, gang leaders . . . out of our country. Well, that’s a presidential job. That’s not for a local judge to be making that determination,” Trump said.The power to impeach and remove from office so-called Article III federal judges, who are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate, sits with Congress. It is a power that has rarely been used.Roberts had warned in his annual letter at the end of last year on emerging threats to judicial independence, saying public officials should refrain from using threats of impeachment to intimidate judges.RecommendedNews in-depthUS politics & policyUS judges are the last line of resistance against Donald Trump“Attempts to intimidate judges for their rulings in cases are inappropriate and should be vigorously opposed,” Roberts wrote. “Public officials certainly have a right to criticise the work of the judiciary, but they should be mindful that intemperance in their statements when it comes to judges may prompt dangerous reactions by others.”Deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, the architect of Trump’s second term agenda, condemned “radical rogue judges” in a post on X last week, claiming they “have no authority to administer the executive branch”.On Monday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the “administration acted within the confines of the law” in deporting the alleged gang members to El Salvador.{"contentId":"86b3b77a-2986-4f0f-9475-886c846dfd68","annotations":[{"type":"PERSON","predicate":"http://www.ft.com/ontology/annotation/about","prefLabel":"John
