# How Donald Trump’s peacemaking ambitions unravelled

During the lengthy discussion between the leaders, Putin rebuffed Trump’s push for the full ceasefire the US had agreed with Ukraine last week, consenting only to a limited truce on attacking energy and infrastructure assets.The outcome of the call — the second with the Russian president since Trump returned to office — underscored his difficulty in translating his vision of a quick peace in Ukraine into a workable pact palatable to both Moscow and Kyiv.Having repeatedly cast himself during last year’s US presidential campaign as an agent of global peace, Trump is now struggling to end the brutal wars he vowed to stop.The call with Putin came just hours after the collapse of a ceasefire deal in Gaza brokered between Israel and Hamas by Trump allies and officials from Joe Biden’s administration in January.The renewed conflict in Gaza came just after the US launched its own air strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen and issued a number of warnings to the group’s backers in Iran.“Donald Trump is not going to be able to reconcile his self-image as a great negotiator with the grim realities of these conflicts,” said Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.“Personality, which in Trump’s world plays such a central role in everything, isn’t working.”The call with Putin also revealed the extent to which Trump’s pressure campaign on Kyiv over the past month — including a public rebuke of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the White House — had handed so much leverage to Moscow.“Putin has managed to give a small concession to Trump without really conceding anything,” Fiona Hill, a former senior director for Russia on the US National Security Council during Trump’s first term, said after the call. “Putin has not shifted anything, and the US is negotiating with itself all over the place,” Hill said. “He wants to win the war.”The Kremlin’s readout made it clear that Putin had not relinquished any of his hardline demands to end the war. The Russian president’s agreement to temporarily halt attacks on energy infrastructure and work on a maritime security deal in the Black Sea would mark a return to deals Moscow made earlier in the conflict. Foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, meanwhile, denied last month that Russia was attacking Ukraine’s energy infrastructure at all.Trump’s push for a quick deal had emboldened Putin, said Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center in Berlin. “Trump has done very little to build leverage on Russia but has put a lot of pressure on Ukraine. The result shouldn’t be surprising,” he said.Speaking to Fox News on Tuesday evening after the call, Trump conceded the difficulty in negotiating with Putin. “Right now, you have a lot of guns pointing at each other. And the ceasefire, without going a little bit further, would have been tough. Russia has the advantage, as you know,” he said.The president’s top officials and prime supporters on Capitol Hill insist that he remains on course to secure his foreign policy goals even if it is taking longer than he promised during the campaign trail.“President Trump is proving he is a president that says what he means and means what he says. He will lead and drive this war, that has gone on for over three years, to a conclusion,” Keith Kellogg, Trump’s Ukraine envoy, wrote on X on Tuesday afternoon. But some critics say there is a flaw in Trump’s approach to foreign affairs that is shining through due to his failure to understand the complexities of the players involved, and the belief that he can rapidly change the dynamic on the ground.“Negotiating the end of wars is extremely complex and tedious — that requires tremendous patience and creativity to find relatively acceptable proposals,” said Max Bergmann, director for Europe, Russia and Eurasia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “The Trump administration looks impatient when it comes to Ukraine and seems to simply want to walk away from the conflict,” he added.In the Gaza war, Trump had just recently held direct talks with Hamas in a bid to move to the second phase of the truce, only to rapidly change tack a few days later and back the Israeli strikes on the Palestinian enclave, plunging the Middle East back towards deeper turmoil and instability. A separate criticism of Trump’s overall approach is that his badgering of crucial US allies — including on trade — has reduced America’s reach and diplomatic clout.“He is more concerned about pushing our allies and partners away and by doing that it means we have less power in the world,” said a former senior state department official. “And if we have less power in the world then we are unable to make the kinds of deals that he would like to see.”RecommendedMartin WolfHow Europe can take up America’s mantle “Whatever 19th-century image President Trump may have of a concert of great powers, he’s proving the limits of his influence by penalising friends and rewarding enemies in increasingly desperate efforts to produce quick wins,” said Kori Schake, director of foreign policy and defence studies at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute. Trump’s struggles have also vindicated Putin’s hardline stance, say analysts.“[Putin] was waiting to see if there would be a major change. He thought the Europeans would probably fold, or Ukraine would collapse. And instead, it’s been the US suddenly and rather dramatically switching sides,” said Hill. Bergmann worried about what further concessions Trump would make to Putin to secure a final agreement. “Any ceasefire that results in the US stopping weapons deliveries to Ukraine is a huge win for Putin because China, North Korea and Iran are not stopping their support,” he said.'Film me!’: Russia's executions of Ukrainian POWs point to a policy | FT
